## Project Summary

Yes Bank is a banking company that was founded in 2004 that offers a wide range of differentiated products for its corporate and retail customers through retail banking and asset management services. It is also a publically traded company. That provides an opportunity for anyone to invest in Yes bank and become a shareholder. But at the same time, it means that the valuation of the company is now in the hands of investors and speculators as share prices are often heavily impacted by public opinion. We have used yes bank stock price data set. This dataset contains 5 different features that can be used for predicting close price prediction using machine learning. We have built machine learning regression model for price prediction. We have used some of best models.

## Objective

Yes Bank is a well-known bank in the Indian financial domain. Since 2018, it has been in the news because of the fraud case involving Rana Kapoor. Owing to this fact, it was interesting to see how that impacted the stock prices of the company and whether Time series models or any other predictive models can do justice to such situations. This dataset has monthly stock prices of the bank since its inception and includes closing, starting, highest, and lowest stock prices of every month
